        <p>
            <strong>Six industrial-focused stocks in the portfolio — and why we

            This year will certainly be known for tech reasserting its dominance
            on Wall Street. However, the powerful snapback rally of 2023 has
            broadened out over the past seven weeks or so to include companies
            whose fortunes are more closely tied to the U.S. economy. With the
            Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes on pause and three rate hikes
            expected next year, cyclical stocks have come back into favor.
