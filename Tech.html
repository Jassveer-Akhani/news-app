            <strong>Electric scooter company Bird files for
                bankruptcy:</strong><br>
            Bird filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Florida federal
            court Wednesday.
            In a release, Bird said it will use the bankruptcy proceeding to
            facilitate a sale of its assets, which it expects to complete within
            the next 90 to 120 days.
            Birdâ€™s electric scooters are touted as an environmentally friendly
            alternative to driving and other forms of public transit.
