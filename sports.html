            <strong>Mitchell Starc becomes most expensive IPL player, first to
                break Rs 20 crore ceiling in auction with Australia Pat
                Cummins:</strong> he two become the only players that have been
            bidded for 20 crore INR or more. Previously, Sam Curran had been the
            most expensive player in the league's history, sold for 18.50 crore
            to the Punjab Kings ahead of the last season.
